### Usage with HTTP basic authentication

The most basic usage of the authentication component is to let SQLPage handle the authentication through HTTP basic authentication.
This is the simplest way to password-protect a page, but it is not very user-friendly, because the browser will show an unstyled popup asking for the username and password.
The username and password entered by the user will be accessible in your SQL code using the
[`sqlpage.basic_auth_username()`](functions.sql?function=basic_auth_username) and
[`sqlpage.basic_auth_password()`](functions.sql?function=basic_auth_password) functions.

```sql
SELECT ''authentication'' AS component,
    ''$argon2id$v=19$m=16,t=2,p=1$TERTd0lIcUpraWFTcmRQYw$+bjtag7Xjb6p1dsuYOkngw'' AS password_hash, -- generated using sqlpage.hash_password
    sqlpage.basic_auth_password() AS password; -- this is the password that the user entered in the browser popup
```

### Usage with a login form

The most basic usage of the authentication component is to simply check if the user has sent the correct password, and if not, redirect them to a login page: 

```sql
SELECT ''authentication'' AS component,
    ''login.sql'' AS link,
    ''$argon2id$v=19$m=16,t=2,p=1$TERTd0lIcUpraWFTcmRQYw$+bjtag7Xjb6p1dsuYOkngw'' AS password_hash, -- generated using sqlpage.hash_password
    :password AS password; -- this is the password that the user sent through our form
```

and in `login.sql` :

```sql
SELECT ''form'' AS component, ''Login'' AS title, ''my_protected_page.sql'' AS action;
SELECT ''password'' AS type, ''password'' AS name, ''Password'' AS label;
```
